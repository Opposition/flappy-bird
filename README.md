# Flappy Bird

This is my Flappy Bird attempt, which I created in the span of a half weekend, so there might be some rough edges.

The original plan is to build a genetic algorithm on top of this ðŸ¤–

But until then, we can enjoy the game.

## Dependencies

### Compiling

To compile the game, you will need Git, Go and SDL2 installed. 

Follow the instructions for Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). 
Follow the instructions for Go [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
Follow the instructions for SDL2 [here](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2).

After that has been done, run the following command:

    go get github.com/Opposition/flappy-bird

The generated binary should be in `$GOPATH/bin`.

### Playing

To play the game, the client will need SDL2 installed on their machine. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2).

Note that the data folder needs to follow the binary:
